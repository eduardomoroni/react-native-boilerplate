# react-native-boilerplate
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eduardomoroni/react-native-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eduardomoroni/react-native-boilerplate)  

Every single project I do the same, so I decided to do it once and keep it available.
This repository is a `react-native init app` application with some libraries/tools already setup:
- [react-native-config](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config)
- [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase)
- [react-native-i18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n)
- [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation)
- [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
- [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
- [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) (as a prettier extension)
- [flow](https://flow.org/en/)
- [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/)

## Requirements
- [React Native development environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/)
- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
- For [react-native-firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/docs/v4.2.x/installation/initial-setup) you'll need a [firebase app](https://firebase.google.com/console) created and having `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services.json` under the [right folder](https://github.com/eduardomoroni/react-native-boilerplate/blob/3140c36cfc8eea32e3a5b6259a4cf6c586f390c4/.gitignore#L68).

## Scripts
There're several useful scripts under [package.json](https://github.com/eduardomoroni/react-native-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json#L5) and [`scripts/`](https://github.com/eduardomoroni/react-native-boilerplate/tree/master/scripts) folder.

## Further guidelines
If would like to see more examples on React Native best practices take a look at [trading-card-manager](https://github.com/eduardomoroni/trading-card-manager) repository, this is a open-source project of mine and a resourceful input for posts and talks I gave.
